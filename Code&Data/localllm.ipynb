Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over \\nafterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered  at this, but at the time it all seemed \\nquite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat -pocket, and looked at \\nit, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \\nbefore seen a  rabbit with either a waistcoat -pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with \\ncuriosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large \\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.  \\n \\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get \\nout again.  \\n \\nThe rabbit -hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so \\nsuddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself \\nfalling down a very deep well.  \\n \\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to \\nlook about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and \\nmake out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see  anything; then she looked at the sides \\nof the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book -shelves; here and there she \\nsaw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she \\npassed; it was labelled “ORA NGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she \\ndid not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of \\nthe cupboards as she fell past it.', metadata={'source': 'Data/Alice_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down \\nstairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off \\nthe top of the house!” (Which was very likely tru e.) \\n \\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by \\nthis time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: \\nthat would be four thousand miles down, I think —” (for, you se e, Alice had learnt several things of \\nthis sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for \\nshowing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \\nover) “—yes, that’s about the right distance —but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got \\nto?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand \\nwords to say.)  \\n \\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to \\ncome out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think —” (she \\nwas rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as i t didn’t sound at all the right word) “ —but I \\nshall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New \\nZealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke —fancy curtseying as you’re falling \\nthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me \\nfor asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”  \\n \\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss \\nme very much to -night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of \\nmilk at tea -time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here  with me! There are no mice in the air, \\nI’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I \\nwonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort \\nof way, “Do c ats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as \\nshe couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she \\nwas dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in  hand with Dinah, and \\nsaying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, \\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.  \\n \\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all \\ndark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, \\nhurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away wen t Alice like the wind, and was just in \\ntime to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was \\nclose behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found \\nherself in a long, l ow hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.', metadata={'source': 'Data/Alice_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way \\ndown one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering \\nhow she was ever to get out again.  \\n \\nSuddenly she came upon a little three -legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it \\nexcept a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the \\nhall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, o r the key was too small, but at any rate it would not \\nopen any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not \\nnoticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden \\nkey in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!  \\n \\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat -hole: \\nshe knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \\nlonged to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those  beds of bright flowers and those \\ncool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head \\nwould go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I \\nwish I could shut up like  a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so \\nmany out -of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things \\nindeed were really impossible.  \\n \\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping \\nshe might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: \\nthis time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round \\nthe neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in \\nlarge letters.  \\n \\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, \\nI’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice \\nlittle histories about children who had got  burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant \\nthings, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such \\nas, that a red -hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very \\ndeeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a \\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.  \\n \\nHowever, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, \\n(it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry -tart, custard, pine -apple, roast turkey, toffee, and \\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it o ff.', metadata={'source': 'Data/Alice_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

First, \\nhowever, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was goin g to shrink any further: she felt a little \\nnervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, \\nlike a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle \\nis like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.  \\n \\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \\nbut, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, \\nand when she went back to the table for it, she found sh e could not possibly reach it: she could see \\nit quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but \\nit was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and \\ncried.  \\n \\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave \\noff this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), \\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she \\nremembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was \\nplaying against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s \\nno use now,” th ought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left \\nto make one respectable person!”  \\n \\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a \\nvery small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” \\nsaid Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I c an reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I \\ncan creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”  \\n \\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way?

It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid \\ngloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he ca me trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to \\nhimself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her \\nwaiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit \\ncame near her, she  began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir —” The Rabbit started violently, \\ndropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could \\ngo. \\n \\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time \\nshe went on talking: “Dear, dear!

I am so very tired of \\nbeing all alone here!”  \\n \\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of \\nthe Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. “How can I have done that?” she thought. \\n“I must be growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and \\nfound that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on \\nshrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she \\ndropped it hastily, just i n time to avoid shrinking away altogether.  \\n \\n“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad \\nto find herself still in existence; “and now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the \\nlittle door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass \\ntable as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small \\nas this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”  \\n \\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in \\nsalt water.

       " Document(page_content='back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come \\nto the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing \\nmachines in the sea, some children digging in the sand  with wooden spades, then a row of lodging \\nhouses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool \\nof tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.  \\n \\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. “I shall be \\npunished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be \\nsure! However, everything is queer to -day.”  \\n \\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to \\nmake out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she \\nremembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had \\nslipped in like herself.  \\n \\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out -of-the-\\nway down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So \\nshe began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, \\nO Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done \\nsuch a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse —\\nof a mouse —to a mouse —a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and \\nseemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.  \\n \\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over \\nwith William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion \\nhow long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first \\nsentence in her French lesson -book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed \\nto quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the \\npoor animal’s f eelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”  \\n \\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you were me?”  \\n \\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could \\nshow you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a \\ndear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as s he swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits \\npurring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face —and she is such a nice soft \\nthing to nurse —and she’s such a capital one for catching mice —oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice', metadata={'source': 'Data/Alice_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name \\nagain!”  \\n \\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. “Are you —are \\nyou fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice \\nlittle dog near our house I should like to show you! A little  bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, \\nsuch long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its \\ndinner, and all sorts of things —I can’t remember half of them —and it belongs to a farmer, you know, \\nand he say s it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and —oh dear!” \\ncried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming \\naway from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion i n the pool as it went.  \\n \\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or \\ndogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly \\nback to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thoug ht), and it said in a low trembling \\nvoice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate \\ncats and dogs.”  \\n \\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had \\nfallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious \\ncreatures.

I’ll soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with \\nthe Mouse in the middle.

      "Answer:  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fantastical tale of a young girl's journey into a strange and absurd world. The story begins with Alice falling down a rabbit hole and entering a world where everything is upside down, including the Queen of Hearts who repeatedly shouts \"Off with their heads!\" as she orders the execution of various creatures throughout the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice encounters a variety of bizarre characters, including the March Hare, the Mad Hatter, and the Cheshire Cat, each with their own eccentricities and illogical behaviors. Throughout her adventures, Alice struggles to understand the strange rules and rhythms of this fantastical world, often finding herself in absurd and illogical situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the absurdity of the world she finds herself in, Alice remains a relatable and endearing protagonist. Her reactions to the strange events that unfold around her are both humorous and poignant, as she struggles to make sense of the world she's been thrown into.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the central themes of the book is the idea of growing up and navigating the complexities of adulthood. Alice's experiences in Wonderland serve as a metaphor for the challenges and confusions of youth, as she grapples with issues of identity, authority, and social norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book also explores the idea of language and communication, as Alice encounters creatures that speak in nonsensical languages or use words in unexpected ways. This serves to highlight the limitations and absurdities of language, as well as the importance of understanding and empathy in communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the book, Carroll employs a sense of irony and wordplay, often using puns and double meanings to add layers of meaning to the story. This serves to create a sense of wonder and curiosity in the reader, as they try to unravel the mysteries of this fantastical world.\n",

They were the last\\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as shespent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on theneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in theiropinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn'tthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because hersister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it waspossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boywas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't wantDudley mixing with a child like that.\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over thecountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie forwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screamingDudley into his high chair.\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\", metadata={'source': 'HarryPotterBook1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

For a second, Mr. Dursley\\ndidn\\'t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of PrivetDrive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinkingof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked andstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around thecorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was nowreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought ofnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help\\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed infunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed thiswas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steeringwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quiteclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley wasenraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man\\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably somesilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\nninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrateon drills that morning. He didn\\'t see the owls swoop ing past in broaddaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazedopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had neverseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectlynormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.

It\\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing aviolet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\\nground.

Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone atlast! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,happy day!\"\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.

It just gave him a\\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Tryingto pull himself together, he let himself into the house.

Forsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled andmuttered, \"I should have known.\"\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, andclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.

Twelve timeshe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole streetwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\\nwatching him.
